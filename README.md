**Features Left to Implement**

- I would have liked to make a timer and a randomized question generator to make the game more challenging. Although this would mean that more questions would have to be added.
- Another feature to implement would be if the user could enter their name that displays at the end of the quiz along with their score.

## Testing

- I have tested this project site on different web browsers. Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox have all been tested and are working.
- Tests while using the site on a Samsung smartphone are also working.
- I have confirmed that the site is responsive on different screen sizes by using the dev tools in Google Chrome.

## Bugs
**Solved bugs**

- I ran into a bug when I was trying to display the answers in the `showAnswerA` function. I would only get ”undefined” as the string for the answer. I checked the array and I realized I had targeted the wrong answer name. I tried to taget ’answerA’ instead of ’choiceA’.

- The `displayQuestionNumber(questionIndex)` function within the `displayQuestion` function would display the question number as question ”0 out of 10”. I solved this issue by adding `+1` to the parameter after `questionIndex` so that it starts with "1". This is because indexes start from "0" but the value from the array (`questions.length`) is "10".

- I ran into a ”TypeError” when the last question answer was clicked. This was solved by adding a condition inside the `goToNextQuestion` function to continue if the index was less than or equal to "9".
